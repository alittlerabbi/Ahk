# Ahk
Useful AutoHotkey scripts i thought i'd share:
* **[open-in-atom-middle-click.ahk](/open-in-atom-middle-click.ahk)** - listens for middle mouse clicks on files and folders in Windows explorer, and opens them in current running atom editor.

### Installation and usage
1. AutoHotkey is for Windows.
2. You must have [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) on your drive.
 * You may either use the [.exe installer](http://ahkscript.org/download/ahk-install.exe) or [unzip the contents](https://autohotkey.com/download/ahk.zip) and choose one of the unzipped .exe's as the default handler for .ahk files.
 * AutoHotkey script execution also works well off of a USB pen drive.
3. Clone or download this branch or a file.
4. Double-click the file to run the script.
